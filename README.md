# Carnegie-Mellon-SMT-Data-Challenge-2023
This is the GitHub repository for a submission to the 2023 SMT Data Challenge. In this project, we are looking at the relationship between the pitcher, catcher, and middle infielder to determine how they effect each other in trying to throw a basestealer out.

Other group members include Jack Rogers, Kai Franke, and Jackson Balch

Only contains the pdf of our 1st place submission along with code for the R Shiny app because of an NDA.
