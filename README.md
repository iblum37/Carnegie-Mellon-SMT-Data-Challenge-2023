# Carnegie-Mellon-SMT-Data-Challenge-2023
This is the GitHub repository for a submission to the 2023 SMT Data Challenge. In this project, we are looking at the relationship between the pitcher, catcher, and middle infielder to determine how they affect each other in trying to throw a basestealer out.

My main contribution was the development of an R Shiny application in which I will provide my code for that.

Here is an example of that R Shiny App: ![Stolen Base Defense](https://github.com/iblum37/Carnegie-Mellon-SMT-Data-Challenge-2023/blob/main/Stolen%20Base%20App.png)

Note that there only contains the pdf and slideshow of our 1st place submission and no code because of an NDA. This means the R Shiny code is, unfortunately, not replicable.

Other group members include Jack Rogers, Kai Franke, and Jackson Balch.
